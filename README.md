# LinePointInterceptForm

Basic swing application that serves as a replacement for complicated Excel forms.  Read more about the Line-Point Intercept method [here](https://wiki.landscapetoolbox.org/doku.php/field_methods:line_point_intercept).

## Getting Started

Upon opening the program, users will be prompted to either load an existing save file or create a new save file with the .lpi (line-point intercept) file extension.  From there, data points can be added into the save file as well as general information about the project.  The program will auto-save the file upon closing of the program; users can also manually save through the File menu.  *still working on further functionality for analyzing data*
